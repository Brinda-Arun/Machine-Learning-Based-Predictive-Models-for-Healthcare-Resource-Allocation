# Machine Learning–Based Predictive Models for Healthcare Resource Allocation

This project applies machine learning techniques to optimize healthcare resource allocation by predicting patient length of stay using historical healthcare data.

## Overview
Efficient allocation of healthcare resources such as hospital beds, staff, and medical supplies is critical. This project uses a Random Forest classifier to build predictive models that support data-driven decision-making and improved operational efficiency.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Training predictive models using Random Forest
- Evaluation using stored performance metrics
- Analysis of results and visual outputs

## Repository Structure
- `Healthcare Resource Allocation.ipynb` – Main implementation
- `dataset/` – Input data (Excel/images)
- `Results/` – Model outputs and visualizations
- `requirements.txt` – Project dependencies

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
